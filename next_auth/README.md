## Page1 approach vs page 
The second approach using `getServerSession()` is better than the first approach (`useSession()`) in most cases because:

1. **Server-Side Fetching (`getServerSession`) is More Efficient**  
   - `useSession()` fetches session data on the client side, which means an extra request is sent to the server.
   - `getServerSession()` retrieves session data directly on the server, reducing the number of client-server round trips.

2. **Avoids Client-Side Fetching Overhead**  
   - The first approach (`useSession()`) makes an API request under the hood to retrieve the session, which can slow down initial page loads.
   - The second approach (`getServerSession()`) fetches session data during server-side rendering (SSR), meaning the page can be pre-rendered with session data already available.

3. **Better for SEO and Performance**  
   - Since `getServerSession()` works in a server component, it improves performance by reducing client-side re-renders.
   - This also helps in pre-rendering the session data for SEO, if needed.

4. **Consistent with Server Components in Next.js 13+**  
   - With the App Router in Next.js 13+, server components are encouraged for data fetching, and `getServerSession()` aligns with this approach.
   - `useSession()` should only be used when session data needs to be accessed dynamically on the client.

### When to Use `useSession()` Instead?
- If you need to **reactively** access session data on the client side (e.g., user authentication state in interactive components like buttons, modals, or dashboards).
- If the session data needs to update dynamically without a full page reload.

### Ideal Approach:
- **Use `getServerSession()` in server components** (e.g., `layout.tsx`, protected pages).
- **Use `useSession()` in client components** that require authentication state reactively (e.g., `Navbar.tsx` to show login/logout buttons).

Would you like an example where both are combined for an optimized Next.js authentication setup? ðŸš€
